Astrology charts in Html5 canvas

This project came out of work I did in a C++ astrology application Astro For Windows, I wanted to be able to do
the graphics in javascript and web technologies and move from a fat client to thin client model.

It uses custom webfonts and json data sources.

The code has a sample page and sample json charts, which can show how to use and implement this technology in 
your project.

The source in src is combined using the build.php in tools, I think it is overkill to build this with requirejs.
